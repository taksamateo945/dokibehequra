"</span><span>I feel like I have several callings and one of them is to be a light warrior for whoever I can reach. There's a lot of people out there who are told even to feel sadder than they have to be. Like s**t's bad enough. So I'm trying to overcome what I'm dealing with, spread love and peace however cliche it sounds. That is the bottom line message for everything that I've put out. So I'd rather focus on that; help people reach their higher selves, their higher consciousness, and just focus on that especially at the shows. When we're together, I feel that energy bouncing back and forth. It depends what kind of energy you want to put out there, but I'd rather be uplifting powerfully.</span><span>"</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-2150886566.jpg><p><span>Sheryl Crow is originally from Missouri.

"This Olay moisturizer takes care of everything: It moisturizes and delivers retinol, so it keeps skin hydrated and plump. It's a great price, too, for everything you're getting. It's been a huge part of my regimen. I started using retinol a few years ago — I can't remember exactly when — and have been very consistent with it.

And then, after I did, it was as if a weight lifted, and the world was just a better place. It was just more colorful and more love, and so many people supported me. I feel like they love me even more, which was great because I was scared. But you know, I met somebody that inspired me to not give a fuck, actually. I wanted the world to know [that] I'm in love with this woman — like, I want to hold her hand in public. I had never been able to be publicly affectionate with anybody or anything like that. So it was just a good, good feeling. I felt like a snake that shed his skin and got some new skin."</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-1783221713.jpg><p><span>Sara Evans is originally from Missouri.

"I feel like I'm always hungry. And lately I've been trying like the whole gluten free diet. And so I don't have crackers anymore on me. So I always have some kind of nuts. That sounds so weird. Some kind of nut, but pistachios in my bag. Unshelled, unsalted. If they're too salty then my cheeks go from like left to right. Like I just look like, you know.

"I have to choose products that I can find in nature. I have cystic acne, so I use a Manuka honey mask to combat it and hemp oil to smooth out the surface of my skin.

"I think I spent a lot of time in the early years of my career trying to learn how to be in the business. I always knew how to write songs and sing – that's never been the thing I needed help with. I've gotten better as I've honed my craft, but the thing I had no idea how to do was be a successful business person. How could I have? I was 21 when I signed my record deal with Sony. There has been a lot of trial and error, and a lot of that had to do with my identity: I was writing music to serve this greater entity that was my business as opposed to trying to be an artist and lean into the creative part of me."</span><span aria-hidden=true>df44d9eab23ea271ddde7545ae2c09ec</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebwell.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/05/GettyImages-1462899302.jpg><p><span>Taylor Momsen is originally from Missouri.

"</span><span>I am super inspired and impacted creatively just by traveling in general, so any time I would visit a place for a couple of weeks, it would change my perspective.
