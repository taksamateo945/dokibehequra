We’re feeling pretty pleased with ourselves on this one.”</p><p>The group’s last album of original material, “Untethered Moon,” came out on Warner in 2015. They subsequently independently released an album of Daniel Johnston covers last year. ““I feel like Warner Bros. really did a nice job of giving us complete creative control and letting us guide our career as we pleased,” band leader Doug Martsch said in a 2018 article. “But I felt like there was a cost and … I felt like we kind of slipped through the cracks a little bit.”</p><p>Ironically or otherwise, Martsch had discussed in earlier interviews how Built to Spill’s goal when the band was first starting in the early 1990s was to get signed to Sub Pop.</p><p>+ <strong>Peloton</strong>‘s latest artist series, which arrives to the home fitness platform today (Oct. 7), features <strong>Usher</strong> in a season’s worth of dance cardio classes.

As a Peloton member myself, I can’t wait to move together as one community.”</p><p>Added Peloton’s head of music, Gwen Bethel Riley: “We developed this content so that anyone who takes these classes will feel like they are a center stage performer.”</p><p>+ <strong>Charlene Thomas</strong> has been promoted to vice president of marketing at <strong>Def Jam Recordings</strong>.

In conjunction with Doc On The Go, the offering launches later in October, which happens to be Mental Health Awareness Month. ASCAP members will be able to access medical consultations (provided by Teladoc, a leading telehealth service provider).</p><p>The cost for a long-term plan for ASCAP music creators can be less than $10 per month, according to an announcement which notes that ASCAP is prioritizing “a holistic approach to members’ all-around health.” It’s needed, as a recent survey undertaken by the PRO proves. Conducted in April/May 2021, nearly 40% of music creators say they feel worse about their physical health compared to before the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><p>Said Nicholas Lehman, ASCAP chief strategy and digital officer: “Our program with Doc On The Go is meeting a critical need. Members have told us how important their physical health is in order to practice their craft and reach their full creative potential. As we navigate the global pandemic, ASCAP is here with resources that can help our community be productive and thrive, so they can keep on creating the music that the world loves.”</p><p><h2 id=optional-screen-reader class=lrv-a-screen-reader-only>optional screen reader</h2><h4 class="o-nav__title lrv-u-color-black lrv-u-font-family-secondary o-nav__title a-content-ignore u-line-height-140 u-letter-spacing-0002">Read More About:</h4></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6topaWotqR5yKebrqukp8Zuuc6vnKxlkqq2rcCMraZmq6Ceua15yaigp6tdqMKjec%2Bop2ato52ys3nAp5tmqJWhvLW7zWh2mqWg</p></div><div id=links><a href=./aaron-carter-attacks-president-donald-trump-in-wild-rants-after-showing-off-new-facial-tattoo-327650.html>&#171;&nbsp;Aaron Carter Attacks President Donald Trump In Wild Rants After Showing Off New Facial Tattoo</a>
