Carolina legal scion Alex Murdaugh had no “visible injury” when he <a href=#>called 911 to say he’d been shot in the head</a>, according to a newly released police report — despite his lawyer’s claim that he had significant bleeding from entry and exit wounds.</p><p>Murdaugh — whose <a href=#>wife and 22-year-old son were shot dead</a> in June — had told police that a mystery drive-by gunman shot at him repeatedly on Saturday as he stopped to repair a slashed tire on his late wife’s SUV as he drove down a quiet rural road in Varnville.</p><p>It came just two days before he was also <a href=#>booted from his powerful law firm</a>, accused of stealing at least $1 million, and also before he <a href=#>entered rehab </a>for drug addiction.</p><p>Murdaugh’s attorney, Jim Griffin, had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Post and Courier</a> that the <a href=#>now-suspended lawyer</a> had suffered significant wounds in Saturday’s shooting, saying the bullet left entry and exit wounds, fractured his skull and left him hemorrhaging blood.</p><p>“He’s very lucky to be alive,” Griffin told the local paper, saying he believed his client was the victim of a set-up by a gunman who earlier slashed the tires to make him pull over.</p><p>Investigators, however, initially said that he was reported to have suffered a “superficial gunshot wound to the head,” without specifying what that entailed.</p><p>Now a new police report <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">obtained by The Post and Courier</a> showed that the responding officers did not even see that — instead ticking a box confirming that Murdaugh had no “visible injury.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/Alex-Murdaugh-02.jpg><p>The report also gives no detail on the reported gunman, who Griffin claimed had even circled back to fire on Murdaugh after the initial shots.</p><p>A possible name, race, ethnicity and gender for the suspect are all listed as unknown, The Post and Courier said. Investigators have still not released any information about a possible suspect.</p><p>Despite the lack of serious injury — as well as Murdaugh’s ability to talk to responding officers after calling 911 — he was airlifted to a local hospital by a helicopter that landed on the highway.</p><p>It was not immediately clear why such drastic action was requested for at most a superficial wound.</p><p>Local outlet FitsNews — which runs a podcast, “Murdaugh Murders” — also claimed that the disgraced lawyer’s black Mercedes had <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“extended mobility tires,”</a> which would have allowed him to drive 50 miles with a flat, raising questions over why he pulled over.</p><p>The Murdaughs are one of <a href=#>South Carolina’s most prominent legal families</a>, with three generations having served consecutively as solicitor for the 14th Circuit.</p><p>Alex hit the spotlight in June after finding his wife, Maggie, 52, and son, Paul, 22, dead from multiple gunshot wounds near a kennel outside the family’s hunting lodge near Islandton.</p><p>At the time, Paul Murdaugh was <a href=#>facing trial in the death</a> of 19-year-old Mallory Beach in a crash of a boat he was reportedly manning at the time.</p><p>No one has been arrested in the double murders, which are still being investigated by the South Carolina Law Enforcement Division (SLED), which is also probing Alex Murdaugh’s reported shooting.</p><p>After entering rehab, Murdaugh was on Wednesday also suspended from practicing law by the South Carolina Supreme Court amid the investigation into his alleged behavior at his law firm.</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnkaGyuXnMrqmdmaWctW60wJ1kp6ddq7a0tcGlnGahnp%2FCs8WMsJ%2Bepl2nsrG70a2gp59dnbJuw8CsZKygn6l6qrqMoZyanF8%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./ashley-pearson.html>&#171;&nbsp;Ashley Pearson: Unveiling the Person Beyond the Name</a>
