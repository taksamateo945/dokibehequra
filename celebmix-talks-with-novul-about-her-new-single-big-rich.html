Her music comes from her passion to celebrate life and to express herself through good times and bad.</p><p>Her signature sound comes with ’90s-inspired beats and pop vocals with punchy, fun-bopping lyrics. Her previous releases “Like Us”, “STICKY,” and “Coattails,” have amassed over 5.5 million views on TikTok to date.</p><p>Novul’s 2022 release, “Chips n’ Dip,” caught the attention of Pharrell’s company, music.com, who supported Novul by blasting four giant billboards around Los Angeles, trumpeting the pop artist.</p><p>Blending pop and country flavors, “Big & Rich” thrums with potent, swaggering dynamics topped by Novul’s deliciously distinctive voice.</p><p>CelebMix <a href=# data-wplink-edit=true>spoke</a> with Novul to find out more about the inspiration for “Big & Rich,” how she got started in music and her recording process.</p><p><strong>What three things can’t you live without?</strong></p><p>I can’t live without having lady gray tea with honey in my sparkly mug, my pink blush for my cheeks, and sadly my cell phone.</p><p><strong>What inspired your new single, “Big & Rich?”</strong></p><p>I wanted to write a fun western-inspired song that reminded me of my hometown with the country swagger, but now that I’m living in Los Angeles, I wanted to talk about how LA is a modern wild west with the luxury lifestyles of the rich and famous. ‘Big & Rich’ is an iconic country band I grew up listening to and I wanted to pay homage to them with the sound and genre-blending influences in the music. In the modern Wild West, there are not many cowboys or horses, but if you’re Big & Rich people seem to gravitate towards you. I’m just a small-town prairie girl who wants to incorporate how I grew up and loves making high-energy pop music about the things I’ve experienced since moving to such a big city.</p><p><strong>How did you get started in music? What’s the backstory there?</strong></p><p>Since I was little, I always had a dream of being in the entertainment industry. I was such a theatrical kid but where I’m from no one really does music or has many outlets. My parents would drive hours to the big city just so I could take a dance class, I’ve been dancing since age 3. At age 10, I auditioned to be one of the only local Canadian talents for the televised fundraiser called Telemiracle and I got it. I sang ‘Suds In the Bucket’ by Sara Evans, my first ever live television performance. From there I got to sing for a private breakfast for all these famous artists who then came up to my parents expressing that I had a gift and that if I enjoyed it, we should pursue it. I started flying to Toronto for vocal training and after I graduated high school, I decided to pack up my things and take the leap of moving and residing in Los Angeles to follow my dreams.</p><p><strong>Where are you from?</strong></p><p>I’m from a place called Paradise Hill, Saskatchewan Canada, a small village of 495 people.</p><p><strong>Did your hometown impact your sound?</strong></p><p>Where I’m from, country music is very popular. I grew up listening to Shania Twain, Faith Hill, etc. That’s why I’m super excited to drop my first-ever Pop Country single while still adding my Novul spice, as this isn’t your typical country song. I’ve always gravitated to more pop music, I love dancing and expressing myself through this type of music.</p><p><strong>Did your sound evolve naturally, or did you deliberately push it in a certain direction?</strong></p><p>I’d have to say over the years my sound has evolved naturally. As I’m growing as an artist and finding myself, I get more and more confident and trustworthy with my creative visions. I’ve definitely found my sound and my audience. I’m at the point now where I like to mix genres and see what my fans gravitate to when I perform them.</p><p><strong>Are there any recording techniques you like to use in the studio?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>I’m pretty standard with my techniques. I definitely do my vocal warmups before the session so my voice is warm and ready. I like to record with no reverb, I like to hear the rawness of my voice. I’ll write the song and build on the production once I lay down my vocals. I like to get super crafty with my adlibs and harmonies once I have a solid foundation built. That’s one of my favorite parts.</p><p><strong>Which artists in your opinion are killing it right now?</strong></p><p>I’d have to say, Kim Petras, I’m a huge fan of her work and super proud of all the success she has accomplished! Also, Charli XCX, being a fan of hers from the beginning and seeing how she has grown over the years is really inspiring!</p><p><strong>What’s your definition of success?</strong></p><p>That’s so hard! I try to set little goals for myself, so I don’t get too overwhelmed, as I have massive success goals. But currently, my definition of success is being able to tour different cities with my music, being able to connect with my fans, and being a voice for them through my music. Getting messages from them saying how my music has helped them or made them feel confident in themselves, that part.</p><p><strong>What can your fans look forward to over the next six months? New music? Videos? Live gigs?</strong></p><p>I have a bunch of new music I’m super excited to be dropping. Being such a visual artist, I’ll definitely have music videos or some sort of visualizer for my fans. My next show is at Evita Party on April 28th in Los Angeles as I’ll be performing “Big & Rich” for the first time! On May 21st, I get to travel back to my home country Canada to perform at the Twisted Element in Calgary, Alberta.</p><p>Follow Novul <a href=#>Instagram</a> | <a href=#>TikTok</a> | <a href=#>Twitter</a> | <a href=#>Spotify</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo7nIsWWcp51ksKa4xJukorBdqa6tt9JmrqKsmGK7sMLUpWSamp%2BqwW60xKtkp52nYsCqusalnGaamZx6s7XCoWY%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./bryan-anger-net-worth.html>&#171;&nbsp;Discover Bryan Anger Net Worth: Details About Him, Career, Home, Age, Income</a>
