"Well, you always remember your first kiss, right?"</p><p>These days, the coming-of-age movie is a cult classic. And while Leopardi is now 41, a new generation of kids are enjoying the movie he made nearly 30 years ago—and learning from it, too.

Throughout the '90s, he spent the rest of his teen years acting in various TV shows and movies. He was in Boy Meets World, Casper, 7th Heaven, and Walker, Texas Ranger, to name a few projects. In 1999 and 2000, he had a recurring role as bully Alan White on Freaks and Geeks. Also in the early '00s, he played Kyle on several episodes of Gilmore Girls.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/alan.png><p>Leopardi doesn't act as much anymore as he id in his teens and 20s. His most recent on-screen role was in the music video for <strong>Logic's</strong> song "Homicide" in 2019. In 2013, he was in the movie Coldwater. He also reprised the role of Squints in the 2007 movie The Sandlot: Heading Home.</p><p>Recently, Leopardi has been working in a far different area: <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>marijuana growing and sales</a>, which is legal in California. According to LA Weekly, this has included working with other brands. His line is named after his character and called Squintz, and he even named one product after Squints' crush, Wendy Peffercorn.</p><p class=p1><strong>For more celebrity news delivered right to your inbox, <a rel="noopener noreferrer" href=#>sign up for our daily newsletter</a>.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/chauncey-2013.jpg><p>Leopardi went from a child star to having kids of his own—and they've all seen The Sandlot. In <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>a 2018 interview</a> with the San Antonio Current, he shared, "I have a 16-year-old daughter who saw it when she was five or six. I also have a two-year-old and a three-month-old, and they actually watched it a couple of days ago. Their mom sent me a picture of them with their grandma sitting on the couch watching it. I think they were into it, so that's good."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/sandlot.jpg><p>The Sandlot cast has reunited multiple times, including on Today in 2018 and in <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>a virtual reunion</a> in 2020.<span aria-hidden=true>ae0fcc31ae342fd3a1346ebb1f342fcb</span></p><p>"Any time we get to stop what we're doing in our normal lives and come together to hang out is great," he told the San Antonio Current. "It's like getting together with family. We've gotten together a lot more lately since the film continues to pick up speed as time goes on and gets even more popular."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/bestlifeonline.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/08/chauncey-2019.jpg><p>Earlier this year, two boys, with the help of their friend, <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href=#>saved their father's life</a> when he was drowning in their pool. They said they learned what to do from watching the CPR scene in The Sandlot.</p><p>Leopardi was asked about the situation by Today, and said, "That's just incredible. You know, like, here we are, 30 years later, and something that someone saw that we did 30 years ago saved their father's life. I mean, it just, it makes you want to tear up because it's such a beautiful thing, and wherever we get the information from, it's great. So to be the force that helped them do that for their father, you know, I'll never forget it."</p><p>As for whether the CPR-turned-kiss scene holds up today, he told the San Antonio Current, "It should be behavior that is frowned upon at any time. But I think the movie was very wholesome even though it was kind of risqué. Obviously, it's not what you want to teach your children, but it wasn't meant to be creepy in any way either."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmialajBrbXFnqanpJmjsm%2BvzqZmrKmlnru1v4ytn55lo5a7pbjOrWSnp6diu6bD0mg%3D</p></div><div id=links><a href=./condition-thats-optimal-during-the-golden-hour-crossword-clue-usa-today-1174253.html>&#171;&nbsp;Condition that's optimal during the golden hour Crossword Clue USA Today</a>
